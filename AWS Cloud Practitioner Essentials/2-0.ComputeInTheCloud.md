# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

Use a virtual server to run application in the AWS cloud.

## **Benefit**
- Provision and launch EC2 instances within minutes
- Stop using when finished running a workload
- Pay only for compute time used when an instance is running, not when it stopped or terminated.
- Pay only for server capacity needed

## **Instance types**

There are 5 types of main instances:
- General purpose instances
  > Balance in compute, memory, networking resource. Used for various work like application servers, gaming server, small databases, etc.
- Compute optimized instances
  > Compute-bound application that require high performance like dedicated game server, high workload application servers
- Memory optimized instances
  > Deliver fast performance for workload that process large datasets in memory like high-performance database or real-time processing large amount of data
- Accelerated computing instances
  > Fast computation support like floating point computation, graphics processing, data processing, etc.
- Storage optimized instances
  > Optimized for storage capacity like high-end storage servers, etc.

## **Pricing**
Pay only for the compute time used

- On-Demand Instances
  > Ideal for short-term, irregular workload that can't be interrupted.
  > No upfront cost, run until stopped by the user itself.
  > Mostly used in a developing and testing applications and applications that have unpredictable usage
- Amazon EC2 Saving Plans
  > AWS offer saving plans for some compute services. Reducing the cost by committing consistent amount of compute usage for 1-year or 3-year term
- Reserved Instances
- Spot Instances
  > Ideal for workload with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand a sudden interruption.
- Dedicated Hosts
  > Amazon EC2 physical servers. Most expensive shit
