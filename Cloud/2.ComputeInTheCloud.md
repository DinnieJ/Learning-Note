- General purpose instances
  > Balance in compute, memory, networking resource. Used for various work like application servers, gaming server, small databases, etc.
- Compute optimized instances
  > Compute-bound application that require high performance like dedicated game server, high workload application servers
- Memory optimized instances
  > Deliver fast performance for workload that process large datasets in memory like high-performance database or real-time processing large amount of data
- Accelerated computing instances
  > Fast computation support like floating point computation, graphics processing, data processing, etc.
- Storage optimized instances
  > Optimized for storage capacity like high-end storage servers, etc.
